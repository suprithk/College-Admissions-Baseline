# College-Admissions-Baseline

Inspired by the gym environments from https://github.com/ericyangyu/pocar

A [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment that simulates the process of college admissions, particularly exploring the relationship between economic burden and acceptance. This environment provides fairness and utility metrics and generates plots to assess the performance of different RL-based decision-making algorithms in a simulation, allowing concrete baseline assessment of their long-term fairness.
